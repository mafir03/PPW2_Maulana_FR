                               <p class="col-6 text-center align-self-center"> Microplastics are small plastic particles that are often found in personal care and 
                                cleaning products, such as facial scrubs, toothpaste, and laundry detergents. These microplastics can end up in the ocean and harm marine life. 
                                One way to reduce the amount of microplastics in the ocean is to choose products that are labeled as "microbead-free" or "microplastic-free". 
                                Alternatively, you can make your own natural household products, such as toothpaste and cleaning solutions, using simple ingredients like baking soda and vinegar.
                                By doing so, you can reduce the amount of microplastics that end up in the ocean and help protect marine life.

                                <p class="col-6 text-center align-self-center"> Some businesses have implemented programs where they tie the removal of plastic waste to their product sales. 
                                    For example, a surfboard company may commit to removing a certain amount of plastic waste from the ocean for every surfboard sold. 
                                    By supporting businesses with these types of programs, you can help incentivize companies to take action to reduce plastic
                                     waste and contribute to the removal of a specific amount of waste from the ocean. 
                                    Additionally, you can encourage other businesses to adopt similar programs by expressing your support for these types of initiatives..

                            <p class="col-6 text-center align-self-center"> One way to incentivize community actions to reduce plastic waste in the ocean is to create cleanup incentives. 
                                For example, you could organize a beach cleanup event and offer rewards or prizes for the most trash collected or the most participants involved.
                                By creating a fun and engaging atmosphere around cleanup efforts, you can encourage more people to get involved and take action to reduce plastic waste in the ocean. 
                                Additionally, you can partner with local businesses or organizations to offer discounts or rewards for individuals 
                                who participate in cleanup efforts or commit to reducing their plastic waste consumption.
